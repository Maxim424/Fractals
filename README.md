# Fractals

This is a WPF application where you can draw fractals.

The application interface is very simple and intuitive. Some of the features are listed below:

- To draw a fractal, you need to select its name from the drop-down list on the top left.
- To zoom the fractal, you can use the drop-down list on the bottom left. 
- Other parameters can be adjusted using the sliders.
- To save a fractal, just click on the "Save" button and enter the required information in the dialog window. 
- If you click on "Save" before drawing the fractal, an empty area will be saved.
- Fractal can be saved in ".png" format.
- For correct saving, it is better to choose default fractal size (in other cases, only part of the fractal can be saved).

Hope you will enjoy it!
